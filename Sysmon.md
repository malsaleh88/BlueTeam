Sysmon Basics
Research and understand Sysmon for Linux. What is it, and what functionalities does it offer?

Sysmon for Linux is a system monitoring tool that captures and logs detailed information about system activities. 
It is part of the broader Sysinternals suite but is specifically designed to run on Linux-based systems. Its primary goal is to help security professionals detect and analyze suspicious activities,
 similar to how Sysmon functions on Windows.

Functionalities Offered by Sysmon for Linux
Process Monitoring
Network Connection Monitoring
File System Monitoring
Kernel Module Monitoring
Logging and Event Collection

How does it differ from the traditional Windows Sysmon tool?
**Sysmon for Windows** is used to monitor activities on Windows PCs, such as processes, network connections,
 and registry changes. **Sysmon for Linux** is used for Linux systems and tracks processes, network activity, file changes, and kernel modules. 
They serve similar purposes but are adapted to their respective operating systems.


Install and configure Sysmon for Linux on a test machine.
